## Introduction

UI eXtension (UIX) comes from the heritage of [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) by [@thomasloven](https://github.com/thomasloven). With an ever growing number of features that go beyond cards and dashboards, UIX was created to keep pushing the boundaries of custom CSS across your Home Assistant UI.
