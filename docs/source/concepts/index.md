# UIX Concepts

UI eXtension does its magic by patching various functions of HTML elements used by Home Assistant Frontend to inject a UIX styling node, `<uix-node>` where styles are injected into the DOM. To get the most out of UIX you can either use [UIX Guides](../guides.md) to follow what others have created, or work it out yourself.

## Concept resources

- [DOM navigation](dom.md)
- [UIX application](application.md)
