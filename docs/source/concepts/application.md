# UIX application

UIX has near 100% coverage of standard Home Assistant Frontend cards while still supporting custom cards not utilising the modern Home Assistant rendering container for cards.

!!! info "Definitions"
    1. patch/patching => UIX is running injected code into the element class
    2. application/applying => UIX applies a `<uix-node>` to element, usually in the shadowRoot, and children as per selectors
    3. ignore/ignoring => UIX element patching code takes no action when running at the element level

## Standard card structure

!!! example
    - Using `tile` card as an example.
    - Does not apply UIX at card level (`tile`) as you would need many different CSS rules which would make theming a nightmare.
    - Base CSS styles via `:host { }` or card styles via `ha-card { }`.

```console
hui-card           ⇐ UIX patches here
  ↳ tile           ⇐ this is `:host` for UIX and where UIX `class` is set
    ↳ shadowRoot   ⇐ UIX applies here, `ha-card` is in light DOM
      ↳ ha-card    ⇐ UIX v4 also patches here but ignores due to known standard structure
```

## Custom card structure - button-card as an example

!!! example
    - button-card has a `div` before `ha-card`, thus not a standard card structure
    - As card (button-card) is still patched you can use CSS vars via `:host { }`.
    - Likewise, you could use yaml selector paths. See comments below.
    - Legacy `ha-card` patch and application is at `ha-card` level where `ha-card { }` will work.

```console
hui-card                 ⇐ UIX patches here
  ↳ button-card          ⇐ this is `:host` for UIX and where UIX `class` is set
    ↳ shadowRoot         ⇐ UIX applies here
      ↳div
        ↳ ha-card        ⇐ UIX patches and applies here, does not ignore as it is not a standard structure. UIX class is also be set here.
          ↳ shadowRoot
```

## Custom card structure - streamline-card with tile

!!! example
    - As host card is still patched you could apply CSS vars via `:host { }`.
    - Likewise, you could use yaml selector paths. See comments below.
    - Legacy ha-card patch and apply for loaded card is at ha-card level where `ha-card { }` will work.

```console
hui-card                 ⇐ UIX patches here
  ↳ streamline-card      ⇐ this is `:host` for UIX and where UIX `class` is set for the host custom card from host card's UIX config
    ↳ shadowRoot         ⇐ UIX applies here for host custom card
      ↳ tile
        ↳ shadowRoot
          ↳ ha-card      ⇐ UIX patches and applies here for card loaded by custom card, does not ignore as it is not a standard structure. UIX class is set here for card loaded by host custom card from the loaded card's UIX config
            ↳ shadowRoot
```

!!! note "Comments"
    - Custom cards that are wrappers like `streamlined-card` could adopt wrapping in each card in `<hui-card>`. This would give all benefits of users who could then include `visibility` conditions or even templating the new `disabled` config option. These only work 100% when using `<hui-card>` as a wrapper. This is what `expander-card` now does and has 100% success. _NOTE: If you see anything like a history card not updating on first load, that is due to not taking this approach_
    - `UIX-card` theme variable applies to new `<hui-card>` patching and the legacy `<ha-card>` patching.
    - For situations where you have cards loaded in a standard way, and also by a custom card like layout-card, you can use due CSS selectors to target both in your themes
    - When you know there is a parent `<hui-card>` patch you can adjust your themes to match. e.g. for streamlined-card, the example below will work for patching from `<hui-card>`, the `*` matching the unknown card type (to UIX) in the streamlined-card structure.
    - The examples show UIX applied to a card. Similar would also work for themes.

!!! example "Dual CSS selectors"
    `:host(.my-class) ha-card` selector for cards loaded by Frontend. `ha-card.myclass` for custom cards using a divergent structure, or for cards loaded by custom cards.
    ```yaml
    uix:
      style: |
        :host(.my-class) ha-card,
        ha-card.myclass {
          background-color: red !important;
        }
    ```

!!! example "Streamlined-card structure examples"
    ```yaml
    uix:
      style:
        "* $": |
          ha-card {
            --card-background-color: red;
          }
    ```
    OR
    ```yaml
    uix:
      style:
        "* $ ha-card": |
          :host {
            --card-background-color: red;
          }
    ```
